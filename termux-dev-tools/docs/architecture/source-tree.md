# Source Tree Structure

This document defines the standard directory and file structure for the `termux-dev-tools` project. Adhering to this structure is crucial for maintainability, scalability, and ease of navigation.

-   **`/` (Root)**
    -   Contains global configuration files (`package.json`, `.gitignore`, `.env.example`, etc.) and the main entry point for the installer if applicable.

-   **`/scripts/`**
    -   This directory contains all the executable logic for the installer. It is composed of modular shell scripts (`.sh`) and Node.js scripts (`.js`), each responsible for a specific part of the installation process.
    -   *Example:* `prepare-termux.sh`, `install-prereqs.sh`, `install-cli-suite.js`.

-   **`/docs/`**
    -   The central location for all human-readable project documentation.

-   **`/docs/architecture/`**
    -   Contains all architectural decision documents. This includes high-level design, technology choices (`tech-stack.md`), source tree structure (`source-tree.md`), and coding standards (`coding-standards.md`).

-   **`/docs/stories/`**
    -   Contains all product-related artifacts generated by the Product Owner, including epics and user stories in Markdown format.

-   **`/tests/`**
    -   Contains all test scripts for the project. The structure within `/tests/` should mirror the `/scripts/` directory. For every script in `/scripts/`, there should be a corresponding test file in `/tests/`.
    -   *Example:* `tests/test-prepare-termux.sh`

-   **`/assets/`**
    -   For static, non-executable files that the scripts may use during the installation process. This includes templates, configuration snippets, or resource files.
    -   *Example:* A `shell-customizations.sh` file containing aliases and `PS1` settings to be sourced by the user's `.bashrc`.

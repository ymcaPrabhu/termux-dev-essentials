# Epic 2: Phase 2 Enhancements

## Status
- In Progress (1/12 stories complete)

## Goal

To enhance the Termux Dev Tools installer with improved user experience, expanded test coverage, CI/CD automation, and flexible configuration options based on MVP learnings and user feedback.

## Description

This epic covers Phase 2 enhancements to the core installer. Building on the successful MVP launch, this phase focuses on improving flexibility, automation, and maintainability. Key additions include an interactive component selection menu, comprehensive test coverage, CI/CD pipeline, and externalized configuration.

## Priority

**Phase 2** - 2-4 weeks after MVP deployment

## Core Features (User Stories)

### User Experience Enhancements
-   **Story 2.1: Interactive Component Selection Menu** ✅ **COMPLETE**: As a user, I want an interactive menu to select specific components to install, so that I can customize my installation without running the entire one-shot installer. [Status: Production Ready - QA Approved]
-   **Story 2.2: Configuration File Support**: As a user, I want to customize the CLI tool list via a configuration file (install.json), so that I can add or remove tools without modifying code.
-   **Story 2.3: Progress Estimation**: As a user, I want to see estimated time remaining and progress percentage, so that I know how long the installation will take.

### Quality & Testing
-   **Story 2.4: Expand Test Coverage**: As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for all 11 MVP stories, so that regressions are caught automatically.
-   **Story 2.5: Integration Tests**: As a developer, I want end-to-end integration tests, so that the entire installation workflow is validated automatically.
-   **Story 2.6: CI/CD Pipeline**: As a developer, I want automated testing on every commit via GitHub Actions, so that code quality is maintained automatically.

### Reliability Enhancements
-   **Story 2.7: Network Retry Logic**: As a user, I want automatic retry with exponential backoff for network operations, so that transient failures don't break my installation.
-   **Story 2.8: Rollback Mechanism**: As a user, I want automatic rollback on critical failures, so that my system is restored to a working state if installation fails.
-   **Story 2.9: Installation Resume**: As a user, I want to resume a failed installation from where it left off, so that I don't have to restart from scratch.

### Additional Features
-   **Story 2.10: GitLab Support**: As a user, I want to authenticate with GitLab in addition to GitHub, so that I can use my preferred Git provider.
-   **Story 2.11: Performance Optimizations**: As a user, I want parallel package installation where possible, so that installation completes faster.
-   **Story 2.12: Update Command**: As a user, I want a command to update installed tools to their latest versions, so that I can keep my environment current.

## Definition of Done

-   [ ] All Phase 2 user stories are completed and meet their acceptance criteria (1/12 complete)
-   [ ] Test coverage increased from 2/11 to 11/11 stories with comprehensive tests
-   [ ] CI/CD pipeline operational with automated testing on all PRs and commits
-   [x] Interactive menu provides intuitive component selection ✅
-   [ ] Configuration file support allows user customization
-   [ ] Network operations are resilient with retry logic
-   [ ] Rollback mechanism protects users from partial failures
-   [x] All Phase 2 features are documented with examples (Story 2.1 ✅)
-   [x] QA review completed with quality gate passed (Story 2.1 ✅)

## Success Metrics

### Phase 2 KPIs
-   **Test Coverage**: Increase from 18% to 100% (11/11 stories)
-   **Installation Flexibility**: 80%+ of users use custom component selection
-   **Reliability**: 98%+ success rate (up from 95% target)
-   **CI/CD Effectiveness**: 0 regressions reach production
-   **User Satisfaction**: 90%+ positive feedback on menu interface

## Technical Debt Repayment

Phase 2 will address technical debt identified in MVP:

1. **Test Coverage Gap** (9/11 stories) - **WILL RESOLVE** in Story 2.4
2. **Hardcoded CLI Tool List** - **WILL RESOLVE** in Story 2.2
3. **No CI/CD Pipeline** - **WILL RESOLVE** in Story 2.6
4. **No Retry Logic** - **WILL RESOLVE** in Story 2.7
5. **No Rollback** - **WILL RESOLVE** in Story 2.8

## Dependencies

### From Epic 001 (MVP)
- All 11 MVP stories must be complete ✅
- Production deployment successful ✅
- User feedback collected ✅

### External Dependencies
- GitHub Actions available for CI/CD
- User acceptance testing complete
- Phase 2 priorities validated by PM

## Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Scope Creep | Medium | High | Strict story acceptance criteria, PM approval required |
| CI/CD Complexity | Low | Medium | Use standard GitHub Actions, start simple |
| User Adoption of Menu | Medium | Low | Make menu optional, keep one-shot as default |
| Test Implementation Time | Medium | Medium | Prioritize complex stories, use mock-based approach |

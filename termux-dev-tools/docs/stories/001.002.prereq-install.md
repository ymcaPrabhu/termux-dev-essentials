# Story 1.2: Prerequisite Installation

## Status
- Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** the installer to idempotently install all necessary prerequisite tools,
**so that** the main application and CLI tools can be installed and run correctly.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The script must check for the presence of the following tools: `nodejs`, `npm`, `git`, `openssh`, `curl`, and `python`.
2. For each tool in the list, if it is not found, the script must attempt to install it using `pkg install -y`.
3. For each tool in the list, if it is already installed, the script must report it and skip the installation.
4. The script must verify the successful installation of each new package by checking its version or presence in the path.
5. The entire process must be idempotent, meaning running the script multiple times does not cause errors or unintended side effects.
6. The script must output clear logs indicating which packages are being checked, which are being installed, and which are already present.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Create Prerequisite List (AC: #1)**
    - [x] Define an array or list of required packages.
- [x] **Task 2: Loop and Check (AC: #1, #3)**
    - [x] Implement a loop that iterates through the prerequisite list.
    - [x] For each package, use a command like `command -v` to check if it exists.
- [x] **Task 3: Installation Logic (AC: #2)**
    - [x] If a command does not exist, call `pkg install -y [package_name]`.
- [x] **Task 4: Verification (AC: #4)**
    - [x] After an installation attempt, re-run the check to verify success.
    - [x] Log an error if a package fails to install.
- [x] **Task 5: Logging (AC: #6)**
    - [x] Add `echo` statements to provide clear, step-by-step feedback to the user.

## Dev Notes
- **Source Tree**: This story will likely be implemented in a new script, e.g., `scripts/install-prereqs.sh`.
- **Idempotency**: The core of this story is idempotency. The `command -v` check before any `pkg install` call is critical.
- **Error Handling**: The script should handle the case where `pkg install` fails (e.g., due to network issues) and exit gracefully.

### Testing
- **Test File Location**: `tests/test-install-prereqs.sh`
- **Test Standards**: Use a series of shell commands to test the script's behavior.
- **Requirements**:
    - Test on a system where a prerequisite is missing.
    - Test on a system where all prerequisites are already present.
    - Test that the script correctly identifies both missing and existing packages in a single run.
    - Test that a failure in `pkg install` is handled correctly.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-11

### Code Quality Assessment

**Status**: ‚úÖ **EXCELLENT** - Best practice implementation

This story demonstrates **exemplary quality** with comprehensive test coverage that serves as a model for other stories.

#### Implementation Strengths
1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Post-installation verification catches false positives
2. **Clear Error Messages**: Contextual error output with actionable information
3. **Shell Compatibility**: Changed from bash to sh for broader compatibility
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: 3 distinct test scenarios with proper mocking

#### Test Coverage Analysis
The test suite (`tests/test-install-prereqs.sh`) demonstrates industry best practices:
- ‚úÖ **Test 1**: Idempotency check (all packages already installed)
- ‚úÖ **Test 2**: Successful installation scenario (missing package)
- ‚úÖ **Test 3**: Failure handling (installation errors)

Test implementation uses:
- Isolated temporary test environments
- Mock PATH manipulation for controlled testing
- Proper cleanup with trap EXIT
- Clear test output with pass/fail indicators

#### Requirements Traceability (Given-When-Then)

**AC1 - Tool Checking**
- Given: A list of 6 prerequisite packages
- When: Script executes
- Then: Each tool presence is verified via command -v
- Status: ‚úÖ VERIFIED

**AC2 - Installation Logic**
- Given: A tool is not found
- When: pkg install -y is executed
- Then: Package installation is attempted
- Status: ‚úÖ VERIFIED (Test 2)

**AC3 - Skip Already Installed**
- Given: A tool already exists
- When: Script checks for tool
- Then: Installation is skipped with confirmation message
- Status: ‚úÖ VERIFIED (Test 1)

**AC4 - Verification**
- Given: Installation reported success
- When: Post-install check runs
- Then: Command existence is verified
- Status: ‚úÖ VERIFIED (enhanced beyond original spec)

**AC5 - Idempotency**
- Given: Script is run multiple times
- When: Tools already exist
- Then: No errors occur, installations skipped
- Status: ‚úÖ VERIFIED (Test 1)

**AC6 - Clear Logging**
- Given: Script execution
- When: Any operation occurs
- Then: Status is logged with clear indicators (‚úÖ/üîÑ/‚ùå)
- Status: ‚úÖ VERIFIED

#### Refactoring Assessment
No refactoring necessary. Implementation follows best practices:
- Error handling with set -euo pipefail
- Quoted variables for safety
- Clear function/logic flow
- Appropriate exit codes

#### Compliance Check
- [x] Coding Standards: Follows shell scripting best practices
- [x] Project Structure: Correct location and naming
- [x] Testing Strategy: Comprehensive mock-based tests
- [x] All ACs Met: 6/6 acceptance criteria verified

#### Security Review
‚úÖ No security concerns identified
- Safe use of pkg install (official Termux package manager)
- No arbitrary code execution
- No user credential handling

#### Performance Considerations
‚úÖ Excellent performance
- Efficient command -v checks (no subshell overhead)
- Minimal redundant operations
- Quick exit on failures

### Gate Status

**Quality Gate**: ‚úÖ **PASSED** with commendation
**Confidence Level**: VERY HIGH

**Recommendation**: This implementation should serve as the **reference standard** for other story implementations, particularly the test architecture pattern.

### Suggested Improvements
While the implementation is excellent, two optional enhancements for Phase 2:
1. **Progress indicator**: For slow network installations
2. **Retry logic**: For transient network failures

**Priority**: Low (nice-to-have, not blockers)

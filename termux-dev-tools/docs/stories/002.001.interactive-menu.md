# Story 2.1: Interactive Component Selection Menu

## Status
- Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer or advanced user,
**I want** an interactive menu to select specific components to install,
**so that** I can customize my installation and install only the components I need without running the entire one-shot installer.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The script must present a numbered menu with all available installation components (8 core components + verification + uninstall).
2. The user must be able to select multiple components using a multi-select interface (e.g., space to toggle, enter to confirm).
3. The script must validate that dependencies are met before allowing component installation (e.g., prerequisites must be selected if CLI tools are selected).
4. The script must execute the selected components in the correct order, regardless of selection order.
5. The script must provide a "Select All" and "Deselect All" option for convenience.
6. The script must support the same operational flags as the main installer (--dry-run, --verbose, --yes).
7. After component installation, the script must run verification for only the installed components.
8. The script must be accessible via both `bash scripts/menu-install.sh` and `termux-dev-menu` (if globally installed).

    - [x] Test global installation and execution

## Dev Notes
- **Source Tree**: This functionality will be in a new script, `scripts/menu-install.sh`.
- **UI Library**: Consider using Node.js `inquirer` for better interactive menu experience, or implement using native bash with `whiptail`/`dialog` if available.
- **Dependency Graph**:
  ```
  1. Termux Prep (no dependencies)
  2. Prerequisites (depends on: Termux Prep)
  3. Proot Setup (depends on: Prerequisites)
  4. CLI Tools (depends on: Prerequisites, optionally Proot)
  5. Shim Generation (depends on: Proot Setup, CLI Tools)
  6. GitHub Setup (depends on: Prerequisites)
  7. Repo Cloning (depends on: GitHub Setup)
  8. Shell Customization (depends on: Termux Prep)
  9. Verification (optional, can run on any installed components)
  10. Uninstallation (special case, runs standalone)
  ```
- **User Experience**: The menu should be intuitive, with clear descriptions and visual indicators for selected items.
- **Error Handling**: If a component fails, offer to retry or skip and continue with remaining components.

### Menu Structure Example
```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║        Termux Dev Tools - Interactive Installation Menu       ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Select components to install (Space to toggle, Enter to continue):

 [x] 1. Termux Preparation (Required)
 [x] 2. Prerequisites (nodejs, npm, git, openssh, curl, python)
 [ ] 3. Proot-Distro Setup (Ubuntu container for incompatible tools)
 [x] 4. CLI Tools Installation (Development CLIs with fallback)
 [ ] 5. Command Shim Generation (Auto-selected if Proot + CLI)
 [x] 6. GitHub Automation (SSH keys, auth, git config)
 [ ] 7. Repository Cloning (Clone project to ~/projects)
 [x] 8. Shell Customization (Aliases, PS1 prompt)
 [x] 9. Verification (Check installed components)

Options:
 [A] Select All
 [N] Select None
 [I] Install Selected
 [Q] Quit

Selection: _
```

### Testing
- **Test File Location**: `tests/test-menu-install.sh`
- **Test Standards**: Tests should focus on menu logic, dependency validation, and component execution order.
- **Requirements**:
    - Test menu display and selection logic
    - Test dependency validation (prerequisites required for CLI tools)
    - Test component execution in correct order
    - Test operational flags integration
    - Test selective verification

## Component Descriptions

For the menu interface, use these descriptions:

1. **Termux Preparation**
   - Environment detection, storage permissions, PATH configuration
   - Required: Yes (foundation for all other components)
   - Estimated time: 30 seconds

2. **Prerequisites**
   - Install nodejs, npm, git, openssh, curl, python
   - Required: Yes (for most other components)
   - Estimated time: 2-3 minutes

3. **Proot-Distro Setup**
   - Ubuntu container for tools incompatible with Termux
   - Required: No (only if CLI tools fail native installation)
   - Estimated time: 3-5 minutes

4. **CLI Tools Installation**
   - Install development CLIs with automatic fallback
   - Requires: Prerequisites
   - Estimated time: 2-4 minutes

5. **Command Shim Generation**
   - Seamless access to proot-installed tools
   - Auto-selected: Yes (if Proot + CLI Tools selected)
   - Estimated time: 10 seconds

6. **GitHub Automation**
   - SSH key generation, authentication, git config
   - Requires: Prerequisites
   - Estimated time: 1-2 minutes (user interaction required)

7. **Repository Cloning**
   - Clone project repository to ~/projects
   - Requires: GitHub Automation
   - Estimated time: 1-2 minutes (user interaction required)

8. **Shell Customization**
   - Helpful aliases, git-aware PS1 prompt
   - Requires: Termux Preparation
   - Estimated time: 10 seconds

9. **Verification**
   - Comprehensive health checks for installed components
   - Optional: Yes
   - Estimated time: 30 seconds

10. **Uninstallation**
    - Complete removal of all installed components
    - Special: Runs standalone, prompts for confirmation
    - Estimated time: 1-2 minutes

## Dependency Resolution

The script must automatically handle these dependency scenarios:

**Scenario 1**: User selects CLI Tools without Prerequisites
- Action: Auto-select Prerequisites
- Message: "Prerequisites are required for CLI Tools and have been automatically selected."

**Scenario 2**: User selects Repository Cloning without GitHub Setup
- Action: Auto-select GitHub Automation (which auto-selects Prerequisites)
- Message: "GitHub Automation is required for Repository Cloning and has been automatically selected."

**Scenario 3**: User selects only Uninstallation
- Action: Allow (special case, runs standalone)
- Message: "Uninstallation will remove all previously installed components."

**Scenario 4**: CLI Tools installed to Proot
- Action: Auto-run Shim Generation after CLI Tools
- Message: "Some tools were installed in Proot. Generating command shims..."

## Dev Agent Record

#### Security Review

✅ No security concerns identified
- No arbitrary code execution
- No credential handling in this module
- Safe use of execSync with quoted paths
- Input validation via inquirer (prevents injection)

#### Performance Considerations

✅ Excellent performance characteristics
- Recursive dependency resolution: O(n) time complexity
- Sort algorithm: O(n log n) time complexity  
- No blocking operations before user interaction
- Efficient component execution (sequential by design)

### Gate Status

**Quality Gate**: ✅ **PASSED** with commendation  
**Confidence Level**: VERY HIGH

**Recommendation**: This implementation sets a **new quality standard** for Phase 2 stories. The comprehensive test suite, clean architecture, and superior UX make this production-ready.

### Suggested Improvements (Phase 3)

While the implementation is excellent, two optional enhancements for future consideration:

1. **Integration Tests** (Priority: Low)
   - Add end-to-end tests with mocked component scripts
   - Test actual execution flow with success/failure scenarios
   - Estimated effort: 2-3 hours

2. **Component Metadata Enhancement** (Priority: Low)
   - Add icons/emojis to component names for visual appeal
   - Add tags for filtering (e.g., "essential", "optional", "advanced")
   - Estimated effort: 1 hour

**Priority**: Both are nice-to-have, not blockers

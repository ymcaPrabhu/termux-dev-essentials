# Story 1.1: Termux Environment Preparation

## Status
- Done

## Story
**As a** developer setting up a new environment,
**I want** the installer to automatically prepare my Termux shell,
**so that** all subsequent installation steps can execute reliably.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The script must verify it is running within a Termux environment.
2. The script must check if `termux-setup-storage` has been run. If not, it should instruct the user to run it and then exit.
3. The script must identify whether the user is running `bash` or `zsh` to locate the correct configuration file (`.bashrc` or `.zshrc`).
4. The script must create a backup of the existing shell configuration file before making any modifications.
5. The script must ensure that the `PATH` environment variable is correctly updated to include directories for the installer's own scripts and future binaries.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Environment Verification (AC: #1)**
    - [x] Add logic to check for Termux-specific environment variables (e.g., `$PREFIX`).
- [x] **Task 2: Storage Permission Check (AC: #2)**
    - [x] Check for the existence of the `~/storage` directory.
    - [x] If missing, display a clear error message and instructions for the user.
- [x] **Task 3: Shell Detection (AC: #3)**
    - [x] Inspect the `$SHELL` environment variable to determine the active shell.
- [x] **Task 4: Configuration Backup (AC: #4)**
    - [x] Copy the user's `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` to a `.bak` file with a timestamp.
- [x] **Task 5: PATH Modification (AC: #5)**
    - [x] Add logic to append necessary paths to the shell configuration file idempotently.

## Dev Notes
- **Source Tree**: This story will primarily involve a new script, likely `scripts/prepare-termux.sh`. It will modify the user's `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`.
- **Integration**: This is one of the first scripts to run. Its output (a correctly configured shell) is critical for all subsequent scripts.
- **Idempotency**: All file modifications must be idempotent. Check if a line already exists before adding it to the `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`.

### Testing
- **Test File Location**: `tests/test-prepare-termux.sh`
- **Test Standards**: Tests should be written using a shell testing framework if available, or as a series of verifiable commands.
- **Requirements**:
    - Test that the script exits with an error if not in Termux.
    - Test the backup functionality.
    - Test that the `PATH` is correctly appended in both `.bashrc` and `.zshrc`.
    - Test that re-running the script does not create duplicate entries.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-11

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation is of high quality. The shell script is well-structured, uses best practices (`set -euo pipefail`), and is clearly commented. The accompanying test script is comprehensive and effectively validates all acceptance criteria using a safe, isolated approach (temporary home directories).

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was necessary.
